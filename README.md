The domain of this project is the annual crab study that takes place at Belcarra Regional Park in Port Moody, BC. The study consists of three main players: 1) the researchers who handle, measure, and record biological information about the crabs, 2) recreational crabbers on the docks that donate the crabs they catch for study, and 3) park visitors that stop by to learn about the research or about conservation at large. The Belcarra crab study is a Metro Vancouver initiative on behalf of the government of Canada, so this project aims to provide an easier platform for Metro Vancouver and government employees to query/access the data. We also hope to better represent the impact of the study, regarding both how many crabs are studied, as well as how many members of the public learned something new by interacting with the study.

Aspects represented by this project include the entities: Crab (e.g, sex, shell condition), Trap (e.g, trap type, bait), Crabber (e.g, fishing license, traps), Volunteer (e.g, name, experience), Role (e.g, role type, time), Shift (e.g, date, # crabs studied), Supervisor (e.g, ID, name), Park Visitor (e.g, name, age group). We model the organic way in which these players interact, i.e, crabs are caught in traps, which are owned by crabbers, who donate their catch for volunteers to study during their shifts, and park visitors stop by throughout to inquire about and try touching the crabs.
